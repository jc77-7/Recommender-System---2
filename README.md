# Recommender-System---2
Applying SVD( SINGULAR VALUED DECOMPOSITION) & ITEM-KNN on Cosmetics Dataset 

**Key Features:**

* **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** A matrix factorization technique to reduce the dimensionality of the user-item interaction matrix and identify latent factors for recommendations.
* **Item-Based K-Nearest Neighbors (Item-KNN):** A memory-based collaborative filtering approach that recommends items similar to those a user has interacted with in the past.
* **Implicit Feedback:** Utilizes user interactions like 'view', 'cart', and 'purchase' events to infer user preferences, with purchase events weighted higher.
* **Brand Inclusion in Recommendations:** The recommendation functions retrieve and display the brand name along with the product ID for all implemented algorithms.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes steps for handling missing data, filtering relevant event types, and label encoding for user and product IDs.
* **Train-Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* **Clear and Modular Code:** The Python script is well-structured with separate sections for each algorithm.
